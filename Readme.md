# ATM Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project detects ATM fraud in real-time using an XGBoost-based machine learning model. It analyzes transaction data, geo-location scores, account groups, and engineered features to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate with high accuracy.

**Model Performance:**  
- F1-score: 88%  
- Precision: 95%  
- Recall: 81%
